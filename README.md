# Demo of rxjava 2 and Spring reactor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vsdev1/reactive-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vsdev1/reactive-demo) 

This project demonstrates the usage of [rxjava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) (in master branch) and [Spring reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) (in spring-reactor branch). It 
1. reads data from a CSV file, 
2. converts those data,
3. enriches them with meta data from an external REST service (via an asynchronous non-blocking http client),
4. exports them to another REST service.

This workflow is triggered by the REST request `POST http://localhost:8080/imports`.

The external REST services can be either external or internal ones (configured in `application.properties`). The internal services has a delay and can therefore be useful to test how the async http client behaves with different thread pool sizes.
